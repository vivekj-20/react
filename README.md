already use that expands into full-fledged HTML markup and CSS rules.these are convenient shortcuts in Emmet for making copies of elements; comments, filters, 
and numbering; matching tags; and even complex CSS features like gradients. 

Difference between a Library and Framework?->

S.No	            Framework    

1.	It comprises of lot of APIs , compilers,        
      support programs , libraries etc.             
2.	It is difficult to replace frameworks.	    
3.	A framework development requires a lot              
      of code that decrease performance and         
      increase the load time.	                  
4.	Including framework smoothly into an           
      existing project is impossible.	      
5.	Its example are AngularJS , Spring,           
      NodeJS , etc.	                        

                   Library
                   
1.It is a collection of helper modules , classes , objects , functions , pre-written code , etc.   
                   
2.A library is easy to be replaced with another library.
3.Building a library requires less code , so there is better performance and fast load time.
      	                  
4.Libraries can be integrated easily into existing projects to add some specific functionality. 
      	      
5. Its example are JQuery , React JS , etc. 
      	                        
What is CDN? Why do we use it?->
A content delivery network (CDN) is a group of geographically distributed servers that speed up the delivery of web content by bringing it closer to where users are. 
Data centers across the globe use caching, a process that temporarily stores copies of files, so that you can access internet content from a web-enabled device or 
browser more quickly through a server near you. CDNs cache content like web pages, images, and video in proxy servers near to your physical location. This allows you to 
do things like watch a movie, download software, check your bank balance, post on social media, or make purchases, without having to wait for content to load.As is the 
case with content delivery networks, a React CDN combination reduces the distance between the server and the user to accelerate the delivery of library assets so that 
webpages would load faster.

Why is React known as React?->
React was developed for applications (Facebook) that have constantly changing data. Since React is a front-end framework or the “View” in MVC, this means that as the 
user clicks around and changes the app’s data, the view should “react” or change with those user events. User events being mouse clicks, typing, submitting a form.

What is crossorigin in script tag?->
The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request.Web pages often make requests to load resources on other servers. Here is where CORS 
comes in.A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain.

What is diference between React and ReactDOM->
The react package holds the react source for components, state, props and all the code that is react.
The react-dom package as the name implies is the glue between React and the DOM. Often, you will only use it for one single thing: mounting your application to the 
index.html file with ReactDOM.render().

What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN? ->
react.development.js - The versions above are only meant for development, and are not suitable for production., 
react.production.js -  The versions above are only meant for minified and optimized production.

What is async and defer? - see my Youtube video
-> JavaScript files with the async attribute will run in no particular order as soon as they're loaded, whereas defer'd resources run in sequence 
(in the order they appear in the HTML) toward the end of the initial loading process, right before the DOMContentLoaded event.
